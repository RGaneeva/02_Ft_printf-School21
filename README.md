# FT_PRINTF

School 21 (Ecole42) 'ft_printf' project. Score 100/100. Passed 2021/07/15

In this project I recoded printf function from stdio.h C library. 
Here I have implemented not all the functionality of the functions: it handles the conversions %c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, %%, and doesn't support such flags as "-, 0, ., #, , +"
